This directory contains assembled display items for a publication (figures).
Figures should be produced in a plain-text format (SVG is highly recommended) from outputs of analysis present in the `results` directory.

SVG figures are then converted using the `process.sh` script to various formats.

ðŸš« In general these files are not added to git history, but may if small.
